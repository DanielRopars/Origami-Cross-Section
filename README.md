# Origami-Cross-Section
MATLAB code to show the cross sections of an origami vertex.
Currently, there are two versions, one in which you manually enter layer heights and one in which they're chosen automatically according to the formula I set forth in a paper somewhere (link to be added if I ever put it out anywhere!)
You may need to swap upMoves and downMoves if things don't seem to work.
